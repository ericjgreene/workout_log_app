This is a RoR app I made to help me track my workouts this year - my 2017 New Years resolution includes losing a bit of weight.

Couple fun things I played with here are:

  Using HAML, had heard great things and it is pretty nice/fun.

  Using uiGradients to help pick a background color.  There are so many to choose from but wanted to try this one out.

  Using bootstrap-sass.  I've been very comfortable in this area for a while but always good to practice as every time I use it I get faster and faster, and hopefully using dryer code.

  Making the RoR app without scaffolding.  It was a nice quick touchup on coding without having much of the work pre-generated.

Future things I'd love to play with:

  This site doesn't need it but would love to build one and write some JavaScript for debouncing, or limiting the time that needs to pass by until a function is called again, to smooth out scrolling in the browser.

  In general just more fun JavaScript stuff in my apps.
